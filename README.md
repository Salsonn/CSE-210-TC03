 Starting the Teamwork...nothing bad could possibly happen.
 
 ### Josh Thieme (T-ME)
 My major is Software Engineering, I have been at BYU-I
 longer than I'd like to admit. I did switch my major at
 some point so that helps explain a bit.
 
 I am married to my beautiful wife, Mia for 9 months now.
 I also have my dog with us and his name is Moose.
 I named him that because he is super chill, not because
 he has an identity crisis.
 
 Currently, I am taking 10 credits of school, working 14
 hours a week at Broulim's in the Produce Department and
 I have been with Broulim's for 2 years now. I also am
 doing an unpaid internship for Sandhill Media Group where I 
 make websites for local radio stations. On top of that, 
 I am also the Ward Clerk for my married ward which means 
 a lot of meetings. I am super busy this semester, but I 
 hope to still be a good team member and get my work done.
