 Starting the Teamwork...nothing bad could possibly happen.

### Caleb Salyards

Hi, I am a normal human being from Boise, Idaho. I'm working off of 30 credits of mostly GEs, but hey, who cares?!
If you want to stalk me even more, I'll direct you to [my excellently fabricated bio page](https://csaly-wdd130.glitch.me/aboutme.html) because I'm doing that for another class and I do *not* want to repeat myself if I can help it.

 I am from San Antonio Tx, I am a computer science major and this is my 6th semester at BYUI.
 I enjoy playing dnd and painting minis for my games with my roommates. I have a doctors appointment today so that is gonna be fun.

### Austin Oldroyd

I grew up in South Salt Lake, Utah for 18 years, then I moved up here to Rexburg to do college.

I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends, and I also enjoy doing outdoor activities such as rockclimbing and snowboarding

I haven't known much about code until I started college as a CSE major, so it's been a blast learning all these new things trying to figure out a path for what I want to do in life
