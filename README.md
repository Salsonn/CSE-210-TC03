 Starting the Teamwork...nothing bad could possibly happen.

### Caleb Salyards

Hi, I am a normal human being from Boise, Idaho. I'm working off of 30 credits of mostly GEs, but hey, who cares?!
If you want to stalk me even more, I'll direct you to [my excellently fabricated bio page](https://csaly-wdd130.glitch.me/aboutme.html) because I'm doing that for another class and I do *not* want to repeat myself if I can help it.
