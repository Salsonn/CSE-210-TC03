# CSE-210-TC03
 Starting the Teamwork...nothing bad could possibly happen.

My name is Austin Oldroyd

I grew up in South Salt Lake, Utah for 18 years, then I moved up here to Rexburg to do college.

I enjoy playing video games and hanging out with friends, and I also enjoy doing outdoor activities such as rockclimbing and snowboarding

I haven't known much about code until I started college as a CSE major, so it's been a blast learning all these new things trying to figure out a path for what I want to do in life.
